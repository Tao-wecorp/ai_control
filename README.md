# AI & Drone Control 
This open book is about applying AI techniques (machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning) to drone control systems. 

## Control
Everything is Model-based: Model-based Cotnrol and Model-based Reinforcement Learning. 

Models are built in Matlab & Simulink. Experiments are run in simulator and on a real Parrot mambo drone. 

### Robust Control

#### Problems
Disturbance signals

Noise interference

Unmodeled drone dynamcis

Drone parameter variations
