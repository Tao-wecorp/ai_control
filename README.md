# AI & Drone Control 
This open book is about applying AI techniques (machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning) to drone control systems. 

## Control
Everything is Model-based: Model-based Cotnrol and Model-based Reinforcement Learning. 

Models are built in Matlab & Simulink. Experiments are run in simulator and on a real Parrot Mambo drone. 

### Optimal control vs Robust control
Optimal control assumes the model is perfect while Robust control assumes the model is imperfect. This book focuses on Robust control applications on drones. 

### Robust Control
A successfully designed control system should be always able to maintain a stability and performance level in spite of uncertainties in system dynamics and/or in the working environment to a certain degree. 

#### Problems
Disturbance  signals / Noise interference / Unmodeled plant dynamcis / Drone parameter variations

#### Solutions
H∞
